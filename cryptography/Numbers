Challenge Name: The Numbers
Challenge Description
We are given an image file the_numbers.png. Inside the image, a sequence of numbers is shown:
16 9 3 15 3 20 6 { 20 8 5 14 21 13 2 5 18 19 13 1 19 15 14 }

**Solution Overview
I extracted the numbers from the given image.
I suspected this was a number-to-alphabet substitution cipher, where 1 = A, 2 = B, ..., 26 = Z.
After converting the numbers, I obtained the text:
  -> P I C O C T F { T H E N U M B E R S M A S O N }
