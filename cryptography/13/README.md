We are given encoded text  
cvpbPGS{abg_gbb_onq_bs_n_ceboyrz}

The hint suggests using the ROT13 substitution cipher. ROT13 shifts each letter of the alphabet by 13 positions, making it a simple and commonly used cipher.
Solution Overview
The challenge clearly hints at ROT13, which is a Caesar cipher with a shift of 13.
I used the CyberChef tool to decode the string.
Operation: ROT13
Input: cvpbPGS{abg_gbb_onq_bs_n_ceboyrz}

After applying ROT13, the decoded flag was revealed.
